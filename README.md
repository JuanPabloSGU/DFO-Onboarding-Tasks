# DFO Onboarding Tasks

## Create a nodejs hello-world docker image
 - To do so, create Javascript file similar to https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/.

 - Then create a Dockerfile and properly "containerize" your application.

 - Put your code on github (Dockerfile + JS file(s) + any other file necessary to build the image).

 - Once you have a Docker image created. push it to https://hub.docker.com/ (under your personal account)
